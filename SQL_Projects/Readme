## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the **Danny's Diner** case study from the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). The case study explores customer behavior analysis for a small restaurant using SQL queries.

## Database Schema
Danny's Diner has three key tables:

### `sales`
- Records all customer transactions
- Columns: `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_id`

### `menu`
- Contains the restaurant's menu items and pricing
- Columns: `product_id`, `product_name`, `price`

### `members`
- Tracks customers in the loyalty program
- Columns: `customer_id`, `join_date`

## Case Study Questions
The analysis answers 10 key business questions:

1. Total spending per customer
2. Customer visit frequency
3. First purchases by customers
4. Most popular menu items
5. Customer-specific favorites
6. Post-membership purchases
7. Pre-membership purchases
8. Pre-membership spending
9. Customer loyalty points
10. Membership bonus points

## Bonus Analysis
Additional insights include:
- Unique customer count
- Total sales volume
- Product popularity metrics
- Order date patterns
- Member acquisition trends

## Technical Approach
- MySQL database implementation
- Advanced SQL techniques:
  - Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Complex JOIN operations
  - Conditional aggregation (CASE statements)
  - Date calculations

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Execute the SQL script to create the database
3. Run individual queries to explore specific analyses
